## List of files

### 'data' folder
Contains the data that is needed to run the experiment. The folder contains both MINIST dataset and Wine quality dataset. In assignment2, we will use MINIST data in the experiments.


### 'Assignment3_data_wine.ipynb'
This ipython notebook file contains the code to run the experiments for the following algorithms: 
-	k-means and EM clustering on original wine datasets; 
-	using PCA to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 
-	using ICA to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 
-	using random projection to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset,and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 
-	using random forest algorithm to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset by looking at the importance of the feature, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 

### 'Assignment3_data_image.ipynb'
-	k-means and EM clustering on original MINIST datasets.

### 'Assignment3_data_image_PCA.ipynb'
-	using PCA to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 

### 'Assignment3_data_image_ICA.ipynb'
-	using ICA to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 

### 'Assignment3_data_image_RP.ipynb'
-	using random projection to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane. 

### 'Assignment3_data_image_RF.ipynb'
-	using random forest algorithm to conduct dimensionality reduction on the dataset, and clustering label and distance in the reduced data. Using these reduced datasets with additional clustering features to train a neural network and evaluate the performane.
