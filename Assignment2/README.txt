## List of files

### 'data' folder
Contains the data that is needed to run the experiment. The folder contains both MINIST dataset and Wine quality dataset. In assignment2, we will use MINIST data in the experiments.


### 'Assignment2.ipynb'
This ipython notebook file contains the code to run the experiments for the following algorithms: random hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, MIMIC. Each algorithm will be applied to solve the following optimization problems: four-peak problem, Max-kcolor problem, knapsack problem, neural networks weight optimization problem. The use will need to install mlrose to get the notebook started. 


### 'mzhang607-analysis.pdf'
Report describing the results and analysis for the experiments ran in assignment2.


## Get started.
Install mlrose module first. Run the file 'Assignment2.ipynb' by following the steps mentioned in the notebook.
